# PCBS Project: Coding a Rodrego machine
##Programming a Rodrego machine according to Dennett's "The seven secrets of computer power revealed"
In his 24th chapter "The seven secrets of computer power revealed", Daniel Dennett aims at demystifying how machines work. He argues against these criticisms that presuppose that machines cannot do what minds can do. If such argument is just saying that machines, today, are not able to imitate human brain's capacities, then they are just stating the obvious, according to Dennett. What is his more challenging claim is to argue that even a very basic machine, what he calls the "Register machine" or the "Rodrego machine" is able to do what more elaborated ones, such as the Turing machine and the Von Neumann machine, can.
##Aim of the project
My aim in the current project is to program a Rodrego machine.
